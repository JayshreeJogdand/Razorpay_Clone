 Razorpay Clone

It's a website that has been designed to mimic the design of the popular Indian payment gateway, Razorpay.
I designed this website, while learning Tailwind CSS, from Love Babbar,I was guided step by step, in my journey, and I feel so confident about my skills in Tailwind CSS now.
And I wish to reflect this website as my mini project, I also have a few collaborators in this project.<br>
