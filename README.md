 Razorpay Clone

This website was created as a mini project to replicate the design of the popular Indian payment gateway, Razorpay, utilizing Tailwind CSS. Throughout the development process, I followed a structured learning path under the guidance of Love Babbar, which greatly enhanced my proficiency in Tailwind CSS. The project involved collaboration with a team of peers, and together, we successfully implemented a design that mirrors the functionality and aesthetics of Razorpay. This project not only showcases my growing expertise in web development but also reflects my ability to work effectively in a team-oriented environment..<br>
